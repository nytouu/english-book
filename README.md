## Introduction

It is Monday 1st July, last week, you and your friends decided to go camping, you haven't done 
that kind of thing in a long time and you're very eager and even a litle bit nervous to go, but 
it's been a while you and your friends haven't hung out like that. You pack your stuff, it in 
your backpack, you take enough clothes for the week as well as your toothbrush and all of what you 
need to keep a decent hygiene. It's 8:30am and you have to meet up with Martin and everyone at the 
mall parking at 9, which means you're late. You hurry up, pick your car keys and drive off to join
Martin at Wallmart. When arriving you check your clock, it's 9:01am, you're barely made it. While 
coming out of your car, Martin shouts : "Hey what's up ?, you're barely on time !",
"I'm terrific ! Sorry for not being a minute faster !". Martin invites you to come in his van, where
everyone is already waiting. You say "hi" to all of your friends while Martin drives everyone to
the camping place.

- [Go to Camping !](#go-to-camping)

## Go to Camping !

You arrive at the camping place and everyone starts placing their tents next to each other. You
decide to follow them and do the same thing, so you pull out your tent from your backpack and
start wondering where you could place it. You find a place that's slightly away from the others,
you're socially confident enough to stay close to the group. Martin notices that you try to stay 
away and comes to ask you "Why are you staying away ? We're only four people, let's stick together!"
"*Wait we're only 4 people ?*", you think to yourself. You realize that, indeed, you are camping
with your actual friends and not some sort of group of "friends" who are only there because they
have an acquaintance in common. Your group of friends is composed of you, Martin, Jessica and Alex.
Those three are your closest friend, you feel comfortable near them, so as Martin said, no need
to go elsewhere, you can just stay near them. After finished setting up the tents, you all decide
to gather to make a small campfire. Martin said it would be a good idea to tell horror stories.
You're a coward, but everyone seem to be keen on the idea so you reluctantly agree. You start 
talking about all sort of horrific things that happening, after a while you don't even know
which stories are based on true events and which are completely made up. It's becoming very dark
and the only things that keep you from not seing anything are the campfire and the moon.
Martin looks like he wants to continue telling stories but Jessica and Alex both seem tired.
I was also very tired so I proposed to the group to just go back to our tents and get some sleep,
to which everyone agreed. You go back to your tent and lie down in order to get some sleep however,
after half an hour, you feel like you can not get some sleep. You decide to get a book you took in 
your bag, but the moment you try to reach for your bag, your hear a weird sound coming from near 
the campfire. The sound makes you uncomfortable, but it's probably just one of your friends.

Do you want to go outside to check what the sound was ?

- [Check sound](#check-sound)
- [Don't check sound](#dont-check-sound)

## Check sound

You approach the tent of Alex, you don't know whether she is awake or not so you try to whisper, but
somewhat loudly so that she can hear you if she is awake, or stay asleep if she's not. You don't
hear any response, no movement, no nothing. You try to do the same for the two other tents, but 
Martin and Jessica seem asleep as well. You don't really want to wake them up. After all it was
just a sound, it might have been just some bird or something of the like. Nonetheless you don't
feel like you can go back to your tent right now, you feel like you need to investigate a bit.
And you did well, after walking around for a bit, you are able to distinguish a sort of shadow
near some trees farther away. It looks human but you're not really sure.

- [Ask if someone's there](#ask-if-someones-there)
- [Approach silently](#approach-silently)

## Don't check sound

You stay in your tent, you get your book and start reading. After a while you finally feel sleepy
again. You hop inside your sleeping bag, it feels like a small paradise, so comfortable and so warm.

ALthough that sleeping bag was paradise, you did not sleep well, you dreamt about a lot of weird 
stuff, you can't really describe those dreams but it felt like they were not yours, like you were
a spectator of someone elses dream of something. Nevertheless, you don't think much of it, after all
it happens, sometimes you just don't sleep well. 

You finally wake up, and the first thing you feel is your wet hand. You turn your head to look
towards it only to discover blood. Your hand is full of cold blood, not only you hand, but your tent
is almost entirely covered in blood, it truly is disgusting to look at, you immediately feel like
you want to puke. But as your try to get up up to run out of your tent, you realize that you had
something in your other hand : it's a knife, also full of blood. You don't understand how your tent
got that way nor why you have a knife that isn't yours in your hand. In paninc, you decide to go
check on your friends, but when going out of your tent, three policemen are waiting, armed. They
point their weapons towards you and scream : "DROP THAT KNIFE IMMEDIATELY !", you don't understand
right away why they are screaming so loud and why they sound panicky, but their request seem 
reasonable, after all you're a man, covered in red blood, who might have just had a knife covered in
said blood in their hand just five seconds ago. You drop the knife and cooperate. They handcuff you
and tell you that you will be driven to the policestation and that you are suspected of the murder
of three people. You realize, but you don't want to admit it yourself, so you ask the policemen :
"Who was murdered ?", the look the policemen give you is a mix of fear, disgust and anguish.
"They are the ones who were near your tent, next the campfire, how can you even keep a straight face
when asking this ? What kind of monster are you ?"

END

## Ask if someone's there

"Is someone there ?", you ask. The shadow answers : "Yes." with the most unnerving voice you have
heard in your life. In fact, this man's voice is so unsettling that you instincly run off, as fast
as you can. Unfortunately, the shadow man also decides to go for a run, after you. You panic even
more, which results in you sprinting even faster. You didn't even know you could run this fast.
But as fast as you might be, the man is still chasing you, with no signs of slowing down. You arrive
at at intersection, what will you do ?

- [Go left](#go-left)
- [Go middle](#go-middle)
- [Go right](#go-right)

## Go left

You turn left and continue running away from the person chasing you. After a few seconds, you 
find yourself in front of a maze, you think to yourself that it's probably a very bad idea
to go inside a maze with someone chasing you with a knife, however, you don't really have a choice,
there is no other way, avoiding the maze would mean slowing down to get around it and the man would
most likely stab you to death.

You enter the maze, you have to find the exit !

- [You find the exit](#you-find-the-exit)

## Go middle

You decide to take the path right in front of you, that way you can sprint without slowing down.
You continue to run and the path leads you near a cliff. You have to slow down or you'll fall off.
The man prevents you from running away, he pulls out a knife, and starts threatening you with the
blade. You can't calm down and have no idea what to do, you start to panic. Your legs are shaking so
much from both the running and the panic, you try to take a step back to move away from the man,
but your foot slips on a small rock of the cliff. You lose control and fall off the cliff.

END

## Go right

You run towards the path on the right, you run for a few seconds only to find out that the path you
chose is a dead end, as you see that, you panic, and try to look behind to see how far the man is,
but when you turn your head, you hit your head on a branch. You fall on the ground, not uncounscious
but almost, the hit stunned you. You try to get up, and as you do, you see the man almost catching 
up to you. You don't have time to start running again that the man stops his chase. He is now right
in front of you.

## Approach silently

You try to approach the shadow, the silhouette is now definitely one that's human. You slowly
but surely approach the person : it's a man, you'er approaching him from behind so he does not
see you, but what's unnerving is that they have a knife in their hand. This person is for sure
looking for your group, as he is standing there, looking towards your campfire. You probably
should do something about him. Unfortunately, there is no signal here, you can't call the police
so you'll have to deal with the man yourself as your other friend seem to be asleep.

What will you do ?

- [Try a stealthy attack](#try-a-stealthy-attack)
- [Try to steal his knife](#try-to-steal-his-knife)

## Try to steal his knife

You try to hit his hand with your foot to make the man drop his knife. You do hit the knife, but he
doesn't drop it, in fact, it did not even move a bit. The strange man notices you : and what 
happens next is quite obvious... You don't even have time to process what to do next that he stabs
you in the stomach. He doesn't say a word and starts walking towards the campfire, where your 
friends are, but that's as much as you're able to see. You fall on the ground because of the wound,
and you start losing your blood.

END

## Try a stealthy attack

You try to approach him silently and you prepare an attack to knock him out in one hit, since 
fighting with him is pointless (after all, he has a knife). You remember your childhood :
you were an amazing karate student : so you decide to knock him out with the greatest high 
kick the the planet has had the pleasure of witnessing. Unfortunately, you precipitate a litle
too much and you forget to take into account the fact that the ground is wet. You prepare your
move, but your attempt is deplorable : you slip and fall on the ground. The man hears that and
turns around towards you. He saw, you saw him and his knife, you both know where this is going
and he starts chasing you. You start running for your life and you encounter an intersection,
what will you do ?

- [Go left](#go-left)
- [Go middle](#go-middle)
- [Go right](#go-right)

## You find the exit

You run for about ten minutes until you are out of breath. You slow down but you hear the menacing footsteps of the man that followed you ! You feel shivers down your spine. You slowly turn back to face the horrendous face of whom wants you dead. He’s looking at you, with his dreadful smile.

“Hello again.”, he says.

His voice is as sweet as jalapenos, you swear you could hear it inside your guts. His smell makes you want to throw up.
You look at him with fear in your eyes. Now that he is not chasing you, you can finally question him.
“Who are you ?”, you ask.
His smile widens.
“I am no one.”
“But… You are someone, you’re human ! You must breath and walk because you have a human body !”, you cry out.
Again, his awful laugh sounds all over the dark forest. A forest where you thought you could be safe and quietly sleeping.
You ask yourself what may save your life. You think about what you’ve accomplished this far : not many. You think about your mom, your dad and your dog. All have always say that you’re their little clown. A clown… Ah ! You’re a genius. You’re going to tell the man a joke.

You say : “I have a joke for you.”

- [“Where do fruits go on vacation ?”](#tell-joke-1)
- [“What do you call a fish wearing a bowtie ?”](#tell-joke-2)

## Tell joke 1 

You let him think about the answer.

“Transylvania ? I like it there.”, he guesses.

You smirk.

“No. They go to Pear-is.”

The man burst out laughing.

“AHAHAHAHAH PARIS IN FRANCE !”

He then folds himself in half. He keeps laughing for at least a minute.

- [Wait until he can talk again](#wait-for-him)
- [Push him back while he’s inattentive](#push-him)

## Tell joke 2

The man looks at you. He’s not smiling anymore.

“That was a very poor joke, human. You aren’t funny to me.” 

You look at him with horror

The man seems more serious than ever while he slowly approaches you. You’re sos scared that you cannot move anymore. You feel terrified.

“It is now time to die.”

He raises his knife upon your face while his smile awakens.

He stabs you to death.

BAD ENDING: You die without getting to know the truth

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          . Maybe he is now what he seems to be…

## Wait for him

ou wait for what seems like eternity until he finally stops laughing for your joke. 

With an amused smirk upon his face, he looks at you.

“You’re funny, little human.”

“Thank you ?”, you answer.

“I, too, have a joke to tell you. If you answer right, I shall let you go.”

Finally, you feel a spark of hope alive inside you. You are going to live ! And come back to your friends, who must still sleep far away from you.

You nod. You will guess it right. 

The man smiles, and asks :

“Tell me, what kind of shoes do ninjas wear ?”

You think for a while. But you have the answer !

- [Boots](#boots)
- [Sneakers](#sneakers)
- [Crocs](#crocks)

## Push him

You get up on your two feet and push him back while he’s laughing his butt off.
The strange man falls on his back but doesn’t get up. Better than that, he seems to don’t move anymore. Have you killed him ?

By the time you start to freak out, the man finally gets up.

He doesn’t smile anymore. For you, he seems more normal than he used to be, he doesn't have that
scary face anymore.

“Where… Am I ?”, asks the man. He looks lost.

The man finally notices you.

“And who are you ?”

## Boots

The man waits a few seconds before speaking again. During those few moments, you feel like you’re going to explode.

“Ah ! You’re wrong.”

He smiles again. His horrendous smile will haunt you forever.

“It was fun, but you lost. It’s your turn next.”

He takes a few steps to get to you and puts his hand on your shoulder. The next thing you know, you go to sleep.

## Sneakers

His smile widens. You didn’t know it could get more awful.

“Yes ! That’s the answer. It’s so funny !”

He bursts out laughing again.

You get up on your two feet and push him back while he’s laughing his butt off.
